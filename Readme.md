This **CIFAR-10 Image Classification App** is a web-based tool for predicting the class of images of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Users can upload an image, and the app employs a machine learning model to make predictions. The app is built with React for the frontend and FastAPI with Python for the backend. This app is specifically designed for classifying images into various categories within the CIFAR-10 dataset.



Use the `README.md` to get started.
